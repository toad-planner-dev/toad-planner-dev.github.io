<h1>The TOAD Planning System</h1>

<p>
TOAD is a planning system for Totally Ordered (TO) HTN planning. It translates the problem to a classical planning problem. For a subclass of TO problems, this is possible without relaxation, e.g., the solution found for the generated classical problem is guaranteed to be a solution for the HTN planning problem. Due to the differences in expressivity, this is not always possible. When it is not, the problem is transformed into a classical planning problem that has a superset of solutions, i.e. the plan found by the classical problem is not necessarily a solution for the HTN planning problem. TOAD provides a verification mechanism to check whether it is a plan or not.
